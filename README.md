# IRIS
## Psychedelic Visual Alchemy

Stretching beyond the capabilities of Windows XP screensavers, IRIS intends to utilize the innate mathematical patterns of cellular automata for aesthetic purposes. IRIS is a colorful scintillating variation of Conway's Game of Life, which ensues patterns reminiscent of visual snow and fractals. IRIS was implemented using vanilla JS and HTML5 canvas.
